<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Iman</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Network Enthusiast</h3>

<p align="left">
I am very interested in networking and work hard to learn more about it. I have strong skills in setting up Cisco devices like routers and switches, at the CCNP-Encore level. I know how to handle switching, routing, and IPSec tunneling.

I also have hands-on experience with MikroTik RouterOS and have earned several certifications, including MTCNA, MTCRE, MTCWE, and MTCSE. In my work with MikroTik, I have set up hotspots, created VPNs for connecting remote sites, built site-to-site tunnels, and used security methods like port-knocking and port scanner detection.

I also know how to use monitoring tools like Prometheus and Zabbix to keep an eye on network devices, servers, and applications, and I use Grafana to create and manage dashboards.

I use Ansible and Python to automate network device configurations and infrastructure setups, including the rapid installation of Zabbix agents and Prometheus exporters. I have some experience with CI/CD using GitLab-CI and ArgoCD to automate the build and deployment of new application versions. Additionally, I have used pfSense as an open-source firewall to secure our network.

I am very hardworking, enjoy my job, and eager to learn new things additionally, I have excellent communication and teamwork skills.
