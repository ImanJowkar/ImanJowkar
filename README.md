<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Iman</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Network Enthusiast</h3>

<p align="left">
I am a network enthusiast who dedicates significant effort to expanding my knowledge of networking technologies, Throughout my journey in the networking industry, I have strong skills in configuring Cisco devices such as routers and switches at the CCNP-Encore level. My skills encompass switching, routing, and IPSec tunneling. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with MikroTik RouterOS and hold several certifications, including MTCNA, MTCRE, MTCWE, MTCSE, MTCINE, and MTCUME. In my MikroTik work, I have successfully deployed hotspots, established VPNs for remote site connectivity, created site-to-site tunnels, and implemented security practices such as port-knocking, port scanner detection, and QoS.
Additionally, I have experience with monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Zabbix for monitoring network devices and servers, and I use Grafana for creating and managing dashboards.

I use Ansible and Python to automate network device configurations and infrastructure setups, including the rapid installation of Zabbix agents and Prometheus exporters. I have some experience with CI/CD using GitLab-CI and ArgoCD to automate the build and deployment of new application versions. Additionally, I have used pfSense as an open-source firewall to secure our network.

I am very hardworking, enjoy my job, and eager to learn new things additionally, I have excellent communication and teamwork skills.
